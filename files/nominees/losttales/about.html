        <p class="texty">Partially written during J.R.R. Tolkien's service in the First World War, these unfinished works are some of the author's earliest writings. Though Tolkien never published the <i>Lost Tales</i> during his lifetime, his son included and analyzed them in the first two volumes of the <i>History of Middle-earth</i> series. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
           The titular tales are the first incarnations of myths that Tolkien would later unify into his legendarium. He rewrote and reimagined many of them over the course of half a century, solidifying the world that would give rise to <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.
            <br/>
            <br/> 
With their archaic, at times inaccessible language, the <i>Lost Tales</i> can seem alienating to first-time readers. Nonetheless, they provide a fascinating look into Tolkien's authorial evolution and are engaging, poignant texts in their own right.
