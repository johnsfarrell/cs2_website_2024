  <h2>How to play AMONGUS</h2>

  <div class="aboutParagraphs">
  <p>
    The Crewmates can win the game one of two ways: either by completing all assigned tasks or by ejecting all Impostors. Impostors can likewise win in two ways: either by killing or ejecting all Crewmates, or by sabotaging a critical system on the map (provided the Crewmates do not resolve it in time)
