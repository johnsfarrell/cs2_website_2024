        History
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        Batman, created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, made his first appearance in "Detective Comics" #27 in 1939. The character was born from the idea of a superhero who operates outside the law, using fear and intelligence rather than superpowers to fight crime.

Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego, witnessed his parents' murder as a child, which fueled his quest for justice. He trained extensively in various disciplines, becoming a master detective and martial artist.

Set in Gotham City, Batman quickly became a symbol of hope against crime and corruption. His iconic rogues' gallery, including villains like the Joker, Catwoman, and the Penguin, highlighted the complex moral landscape he navigated.

Over the decades, Batman has evolved through comic books, television series, animated shows, and blockbuster films, becoming one of the most enduring and recognizable figures in popular culture. The character explores themes of justice, vengeance, and the psychological impact of trauma, making him a compelling and multifaceted hero.

        Top Movies
    </h2>

    <p>
        Some of the top Batman movies have significantly shaped the character's legacy and appeal. Tim Burton's "Batman" (1989) and its sequel, "Batman Returns" (1992), brought a darker, more gothic tone to the franchise, with Michael Keaton donning the cape. Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight" trilogy, particularly "The Dark Knight" (2008), redefined superhero cinema with its gritty realism and Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of the Joker. Additionally, animated films like "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm" (1993) and "The Lego Batman Movie" (2017) showcased the character's versatility, appealing to both long-time fans and new audiences. Each of these films has contributed to Batman's enduring legacy as a complex and compelling hero.
