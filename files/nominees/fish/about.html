        The New Zealand coastal waters are home to a large variety of fish species. The waters are subtropical for the majority of the mainland and subantarctic in the southern end of the country. <br>
        Many of the fish species inhabit a large range across both main islands of New Zealand, however there are clear boundaries where certain species will rarely be found outside of due to the variation in ocean climate. <br>
